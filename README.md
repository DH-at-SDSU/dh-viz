# SDSU Digital Humanities Initiative Network Visualization

SDSU's Digital Humanities and Global Diversity Initiative web-based visual topometric network mapping and archive of humanities and qualitative social science research by students, faculty, and alumni. [Digital Bridges](https://digitalbridges.sdsu.edu) is a web-based visual networked map of digital humanities and social science research at SDSU. It will make visible the range of expertise and interests in our community, connect researchers across disciplines, and locate new opportunities for interdisciplinary collaboration. The goal is to eventually scale the site up for researchers across the CSU to create profiles and connect with each. The project is funded through a CSU Innovation Minigrant (awarded June 2018).

Co-PIs: Joanna Brooks, Pam Lach, Jessica Pressman
